# Templates

This repo contains templates you can check out to help you build the documentation in your project repos.

## How to use the templates

- If you don't have a repo for your project already, [create a repo from our template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template). This will include all the files you need!
- If you already have a repo and you'd like to just add these docs files to it, you can:
  - Open the file you'd like to copy
  - Click the "Raw" button to preserve the formatting
  - Create a new file and paste the text into it
- [Use our guides](https://ucospo.net/oss-resources/#template-guides) to help you customize the templates for your project

Please feel free to [reach out to our Laura](mailto:lalangdon@ucdavis.edu), our Community Manager, if you have any questions!

## Formatting considerations

As you'll see in the templates, these files are most commonly written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). It's important to make sure your files are accessible, and this is a great guide: [Accessible Markdown](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/09/improving-accessibility-of-markdown/).
