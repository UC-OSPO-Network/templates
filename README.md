## Formatting considerations

As you'll see in the templates, these files are most commonly written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), 



• Headings capitalized with an initial capital, following standard English sentence rules
• Headings prefixed with #/##/### to indicate level of heading (h1/h2/h3) followed by a blank line
• Project name is the first line of the document, and only level one heading (#)
• Two lines prior to ##/### headings
• No leading or trailing spaces
• Bulleted lists denoted by dashes (-)
• Ordered lists use "1", for easier updates and to avoid errors (see Configuration)
• Nested lists indented with 4 spaces
• Links should have a meaningful link text, for example:[Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) (i.e. not just the URL)
• Text manually word-wrapped within around 80 cols
