## Formatting considerations

As you'll see in the templates, these files are most commonly written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). It's important to make sure your files are accessible, and this is a great guide: [Accessible Markdown](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/09/improving-accessibility-of-markdown/).
