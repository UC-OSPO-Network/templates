This is a template document for UC projects that requires editing before it is ready to use, and you can find guides for using these templates on [our website](https://ucospo.net/oss-resources/#template-guides). You can search for "TODO" to identify areas that require customization; e.g. line 3 above lets you know you should rename this file. Please feel free to [reach out to our Laura](mailto:lalangdon@ucdavis.edu), our Community Manager, if you have any questions!

Search for the word `TODO` in this template for links that need to be customized. When you finish editing ðŸš§ the template, remove the `TODO` bits.

## Come to Community Calls

[TODO: Maybe your project doesn't have [community calls](https://opensource.com/open-organization/16/1/community-calls-will-increase-participation-your-open-organization), in which case you can omit this section. But you might consider trying them out!]

Anyone interested in our project is welcome to come to any of [our community calls](TODO: add a link to your community calls)! You never need an invite to join us. In fact, we want you to join us, even if you donâ€™t have anything you feel like you want to contribute. Just being there is enough!

You donâ€™t have to turn on your video. The first time you come, just introducing yourself is perfectly fine. Over time, we hope that you feel comfortable voicing your opinions, giving feedback on othersâ€™ ideas, and even sharing your own ideas, and experiences.

## Creating Issues

## Finding an Issue

Sometimes there wonâ€™t be any issues with these labels. Thatâ€™s ok! There is likely still something for you to work on. If you want to contribute but you donâ€™t know where to start or can't find a suitable issue, you can [TODO: explain how people can ask for an issue to work on].
