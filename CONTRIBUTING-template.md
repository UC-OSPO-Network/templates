# CONTRIBUTING

[TODO: delete the paragraph below]

This is a template document for UC projects that requires editing
before it is ready to use, and you can find the instructions for using this template on [our website](üöß). You can search for "TODO" to identify areas that
require customization; e.g. line 3 above lets you know you should delete this paragraph. üöß Link to contact us for help

## Ways to Contribute

[TODO: ]

We welcome many different types of contributions including:

- New features
- Builds, CI/CD
- Bug fixes
- Documentation
- Issue Triage
- Answering questions on Slack/Mailing List
- Web design
- Communications/Social Media/Blog Posts
- Release management

Not everything happens through a GitHub pull request. Please come to our
[meetings](TODO) or [contact us](TODO) and let's discuss how we can work
together. 

## Come to Meetings

[TODO: ]

Absolutely everyone is welcome to come to any of our meetings. You never need an invite to join us. In fact, we want you to join us, even if you don‚Äôt have anything you feel like you want to contribute. Just being there is enough!

You can find out more about our meetings [here](TODO). You don‚Äôt have to turn on your video. The first time you come, introducing yourself is more than enough. Over time, we hope that you feel comfortable voicing your opinions, giving feedback on others‚Äô ideas, and even sharing your own ideas, and experiences.

## Creating issues

[TODO: üöß]

You might also like to create an issue template:

- [GitHub issue templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates)
- [GitLab issue templates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/.gitlab/issue_templates)

## Finding an Issue

We have good first issues for new contributors and help wanted issues suitable for any contributor. [good first issue](TODO) has extra information to help you make your first contribution. [help wanted](TODO) are issues suitable for someone who isn't a core maintainer and is good to move onto after your first pull request.

Sometimes there won‚Äôt be any issues with these labels. That‚Äôs ok! There is likely still something for you to work on. If you want to contribute but you don‚Äôt know where to start or can't find a suitable issue, you can [TODO: explain how people can ask for an issue to work on].

Once you see an issue that you'd like to work on, please post a comment saying that you want to work on it. Something like "I want to work on this" is fine.

### Pull Request Checklist

When you submit your pull request, or you push new commits to it, our automated systems will run some checks on your new code. We require that your pull request passes these checks, but we also have more criteria than just that before we can accept and merge it. We recommend that you check the following things locally before you submit your code:
