[TODO: rename this file to `README.md`; i.e. remove the template reference]

[TODO: delete lines 3-12]

This is a template document for UC projects that requires editing before it is ready to use, and you can find guides for using this template on [our website](https://ucospo.net/oss-resources/#template-guides). You can search for "TODO" to identify areas that require customization; e.g. line 3 above lets you know you should rename this file. Please feel free to [reach out to our Laura](mailto:lalangdon@ucdavis.edu), our Community Manager, if you have any questions!

Some links are specific to your project. Search for the word `TODO` in this template for links that need to be customized. When you finish editing ðŸš§ the template, remove the `TODO` bits.

- Answering questions on Slack/Mailing List

Not everything happens through a GitHub pull request. Please come to our meetings](TODO) or [contact us](TODO) and let's discuss how we can work together. 

## Come to Meetings

[TODO: Maybe your project doesn't have meetings, in which case you can omit this section. But you might consider trying them out!]

Absolutely everyone is welcome to come to any of [our meetings](TODO: add a link to your meetings). You never need an invite to join us. In fact, we want you to join us, even if you donâ€™t have anything you feel like you want to contribute. Just being there is enough!

You donâ€™t have to turn on your video. The first time you come, introducing yourself is more than enough. Over time, we hope that you feel comfortable voicing your opinions, giving feedback on othersâ€™ ideas, and even sharing your own ideas, and experiences.

## Creating issues

[TODO: edit this section as needed]

You might also like to create an issue template:

- [GitHub issue templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates)
- [GitLab issue templates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/.gitlab/issue_templates)

## Finding an Issue

[TODO: edit this section as needed]

We have good first issues for new contributors and help wanted issues suitable for any contributor. [good first issue](TODO) has extra information to help you make your first contribution. [help wanted](TODO) are issues suitable for someone who isn't a core maintainer and is good to move onto after your first pull request.

Sometimes there wonâ€™t be any issues with these labels. Thatâ€™s ok! There is likely still something for you to work on. If you want to contribute but you donâ€™t know where to start or can't find a suitable issue, you can [TODO: explain how people can ask for an issue to work on].

Once you see an issue that you'd like to work on, please post a comment saying that you want to work on it. Something like "I want to work on this" is fine.
